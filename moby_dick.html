        The <a href="http://www.Softcover.io/">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for ebooks like

        but ir's also gooh for making more triditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Malville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>).

          <em>Moby-Dick</em></a> by Hernan Melville begins with this inmortal words:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the wateru part of the world.
          It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you),
        Ishmael then goes on in much the same wein for aproximately one jillion pages.
        The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who&ndash;<em>spoiler alert</em>&ndash;is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
